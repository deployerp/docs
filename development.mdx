<Info>
  **Prerequisites**:
  - deployERP account with API access enabled
  - Basic understanding of RESTful APIs
  - Familiarity with Git for version control
  - Your preferred programming language for API integration
</Info>

Follow these steps to integrate deployERP into your development workflow for Odoo server management.

<Steps>
<Step title="Generate API credentials">

Log in to your deployERP dashboard and generate API credentials:

1. Navigate to Settings > API Access
2. Click "Generate New API Key"
3. Save your API key and secret securely

```bash
# Example of storing credentials in environment variables
export DEPLOYERP_API_KEY="your_api_key"
export DEPLOYERP_API_SECRET="your_api_secret"
```
</Step>

<Step title="Install the deployERP SDK (optional)">

We provide SDKs for popular programming languages to simplify API integration:

```bash
# For Python
pip install deployerp-sdk

# For Node.js
npm install deployerp-sdk

# For PHP
composer require deployerp/deployerp-sdk
```

You can also use the REST API directly with your preferred HTTP client.

</Step>

<Step title="Set up Git integration">

Connect your Git repositories to deployERP for automated Odoo module deployment:

1. In your deployERP dashboard, go to Developer Tools > Git Integration
2. Add your repository URL and credentials
3. Configure branch and deployment settings

This allows deployERP to automatically deploy your Odoo modules when you push changes.

</Step>
</Steps>

## API Overview

The deployERP API allows you to programmatically manage your Odoo servers. Here's a quick overview of the main endpoints:

```bash
# Base URL for all API requests
BASE_URL="https://api.deployerp.com/v1"

# Authentication
AUTH_ENDPOINT="${BASE_URL}/auth/token"

# Server management
SERVERS_ENDPOINT="${BASE_URL}/servers"

# Backups
BACKUPS_ENDPOINT="${BASE_URL}/backups"

# Monitoring
MONITORING_ENDPOINT="${BASE_URL}/monitoring"
```

All API requests require authentication using your API key and secret.

## Authentication

To authenticate with the deployERP API, you need to obtain an access token:

```python
# Python example using requests
import requests

auth_url = "https://api.deployerp.com/v1/auth/token"
response = requests.post(auth_url, json={
    "api_key": "your_api_key",
    "api_secret": "your_api_secret"
})

token = response.json()["access_token"]

# Use this token in subsequent requests
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
```

## Server Management

Here are some common server management operations you can perform with the API:

```python
# Python example for server management
import requests

base_url = "https://api.deployerp.com/v1"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

# List all servers
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/servers", headers=headers)
servers = response.json()["data"]

# Deploy a new Odoo server
response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/servers", headers=headers, json={
    "name": "Production Odoo",
    "provider": "digitalocean",
    "region": "nyc3",
    "size": "s-2vcpu-4gb",
    "odoo_version": "17.0",
    "addons": ["web", "mail", "crm"]
})

# Get server details
server_id = "srv-123456"
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/servers/{server_id}", headers=headers)
```

## Backup Management

Manage your Odoo server backups programmatically:

```python
# Python example for backup management
import requests

base_url = "https://api.deployerp.com/v1"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
server_id = "srv-123456"

# Create a new backup
response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/servers/{server_id}/backups", headers=headers)
backup_id = response.json()["data"]["id"]

# List all backups for a server
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/servers/{server_id}/backups", headers=headers)
backups = response.json()["data"]

# Download a backup
backup_id = "bkp-123456"
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/backups/{backup_id}/download", headers=headers)
# Handle the file download in your application
```

## Webhooks

Set up webhooks to receive real-time notifications about your Odoo servers:

```python
# Python example for webhook management
import requests

base_url = "https://api.deployerp.com/v1"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

# Create a new webhook
response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/webhooks", headers=headers, json={
    "url": "https://your-app.com/webhook-receiver",
    "events": ["server.created", "server.updated", "backup.completed", "alert.triggered"],
    "secret": "your_webhook_secret"
})

# List all webhooks
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/webhooks", headers=headers)
webhooks = response.json()["data"]
```

Your application will receive JSON payloads when the specified events occur.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Authentication failed'>

    This may be due to invalid API credentials. Try the following:
    1. Verify your API key and secret are correct
    2. Ensure your account has API access enabled
    3. Check if your API key has been revoked or expired
    4. Confirm you're using the correct API endpoint
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Rate limiting errors">
  
    The API has rate limits to prevent abuse. If you're receiving rate limit errors:
    ```json
    {
      "error": "rate_limit_exceeded",
      "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds."
    }
    ```
    Implement exponential backoff in your code and consider caching responses when appropriate.
