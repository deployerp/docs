## Introduction

Servers are the foundation of your Odoo deployment infrastructure. deployERP simplifies server management by automating provisioning, configuration, monitoring, and maintenance tasks.

## What is a Server?

In deployERP, a server is a virtual machine that:
- Hosts one or more Odoo instances
- Runs PostgreSQL database server
- Includes all necessary dependencies
- Is optimized for Odoo performance

<Info>
  Each server is provisioned in your own cloud account, giving you complete control and ownership of your infrastructure.

## Server Components

Each deployERP server includes:

### System Software
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
- **Python**: Multiple versions (3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11)
- **PostgreSQL**: Version 14 or 15
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and SSL termination
- **Supervisor**: Process management
- **Redis**: Caching and sessions

### Odoo Requirements
- **wkhtmltopdf**: PDF generation
- **Node.js**: Asset compilation
- **Python packages**: All Odoo dependencies
- **System libraries**: Image processing, XML, etc.

### Management Tools
- **deployERP Agent**: Monitoring and management
- **Fail2ban**: Security and DDoS protection
- **UFW**: Firewall configuration
- **Certbot**: SSL certificate management

## Server Types

### Production Servers
Optimized for performance and reliability:
- High-performance settings
- Automated backups
- 24/7 monitoring
- Auto-healing enabled
- Multi-worker configuration

### Development Servers
Cost-effective for testing:
- Debug mode available
- Lower resource allocation
- Flexible configuration
- Quick provisioning

### Staging Servers
Mirror production environments:
- Production-like settings
- Separate database
- Testing ground for updates
- Performance profiling

## Server Management Features

### Monitoring Dashboard

Real-time metrics including:
- CPU utilization
- Memory usage
- Disk I/O
- Network traffic
- Database connections
- Response times

### Auto-Healing

Automatic recovery from common issues:
- Service restarts
- Memory leak detection
- Disk space management
- Connection pool recovery
- Process resurrection

### Security Features

Built-in security measures:
- Firewall rules
- DDoS protection
- SSH key management
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Regular security updates

## Server Configuration

### Resource Allocation

| Component | Configurable | Range |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| vCPU | Yes | 1-64 cores |
| RAM | Yes | 2-256 GB |
| Storage | Yes | 20GB-16TB |
| Bandwidth | Provider-dependent | Varies |

### Network Configuration

- **Public IP**: Automatically assigned
- **Private networking**: Available on supported providers
- **Firewall rules**: Customizable
- **Load balancing**: Enterprise feature

### Database Configuration

PostgreSQL settings optimized for Odoo:
- Connection pooling
- Memory allocation
- Query optimization
- Automatic vacuuming
- Backup scheduling

## Performance Optimization

deployERP automatically optimizes servers for Odoo:

### Worker Configuration
```python
# Automatic calculation based on resources
workers = (cpu_cores * 2) + 1
max_cron_threads = 2
limit_memory_hard = ram_gb * 0.9 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024
limit_memory_soft = ram_gb * 0.8 * 1024 * 1024 * 1024
```

### Caching Strategy
- Static asset caching
- Database query caching
- Session storage in Redis
- CDN integration (optional)

## Server States

Servers can be in various states:

| State | Description | Actions Available |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Provisioning** | Server being created | Wait, Cancel |
| **Running** | Operational | All actions |
| **Stopped** | Temporarily halted | Start, Delete |
| **Updating** | Maintenance in progress | Wait |
| **Error** | Issue detected | Diagnose, Restart |

## Backup Strategy

Automated backup features:
- Daily snapshots
- Point-in-time recovery
- Cross-region replication
- Encrypted storage
- Retention policies

<Warning>
  Always configure backups for production servers. Data loss without backups is irreversible.
</Warning>

## Scaling Options

### Vertical Scaling
Resize server resources:
- Increase CPU/RAM
- Expand storage
- Minimal downtime
- Automatic migration

### Horizontal Scaling
Add more servers:
- Load distribution
- Geographic redundancy
- High availability
- Failover support

## Monitoring Alerts

Configure alerts for:
- Resource thresholds
- Service failures
- Security events
- Backup failures
- Performance degradation

## Cost Management

Track and optimize costs:
- Resource utilization reports
- Cost breakdown by server
- Optimization recommendations
- Budget alerts

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| High CPU usage | Inefficient queries | Optimize database indexes |
| Memory errors | Insufficient RAM | Increase server resources |
| Slow response | Network latency | Use CDN or closer region |
| Connection errors | Firewall rules | Check security groups |
